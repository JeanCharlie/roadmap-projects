# Task Tracker CLI

**A simple command-line interface (CLI) application to help you manage tasks efficiently.**  
This project allows you to add, update, delete, and view tasks directly from the command line, with task data stored in a JSON file.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a unique ID, description, and timestamps.
- **Update Tasks**: Modify task details, including description and status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Status Management**: Mark tasks as `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- **Task Filtering**: View tasks by their status, such as completed or pending tasks.
- **Data Persistence**: All tasks are saved in a JSON file, allowing for data persistence between sessions.
